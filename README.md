and virtualbox providers for local development. The components are:
  
  - [Ansible playbooks](https://github.com/ssx/caffine-ansible)

### Development Stack
This stack contains PHP5.6, nginx, node, composer and more. For a full picture, 
take a look through the Ansible playbooks.

---

### Use without building
If you wish to use this development environment without building the images, use the 
Dockerhub hosted image:
 
    docker run -itP hellossx/lamp 
 
---

### Pull Ansible submodules
You'll need to pull in the shared ansible scripts, using:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update


This should create/update the `ansible` directory which contains the playbooks 
used to configure the development environment.

---

### Build
To build this image, after cloing the repo and updating the submodules, run the 
following command:

    docker build --no-cache -t hellossx/caffine:latest .
